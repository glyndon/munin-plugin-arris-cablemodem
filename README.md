# munin-plugin-arris
Munin plugin(s) that will report the data available from an Arris cablemodem's web interface

The 'arris' file is an adaptation of a version forked from <name>'s version, and now heavily altered to bring it up-to-date, and to incorporate some features I've found useful.

The 'wan_json" file is my older effort that I'm migrating features from, into 'arris'
