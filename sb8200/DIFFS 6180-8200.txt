Differences between the SB6180 and SB8200 versions:

1) Uptime URL: http://192.168.100.1/cmswinfo.html
2) In Speedtest config: graph_args --base 1000 -l 0
3) One extra .next_sibling in the parse for "Allowed" after finding "DOCSIS Network Access Enabled"
4) There's no Channel ID column for downstream, so change the index for downchannel to 0
5) The columns with the data are 4,5,6,7 versus 5,6,7,8 on the 6180
